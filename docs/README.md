# 🚀 DeepSync – Real-Time Usage & Focus Tracker

A **modern, responsive web application** that tracks and visualizes user screen time, app usage, and productivity sessions — built using **HTML**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Firebase Firestore**.

---

## 📘 Overview

**DeepSync** helps users monitor their daily digital activities in real-time.  
It fetches and visualizes data such as total screen time, app-wise usage, and focus sessions using **Firebase Firestore’s real-time listeners** — all displayed beautifully using **Tailwind CSS components**.

---

## 🧩 Key Features

### 🌐 Frontend
- **Modern HTML5 architecture** with semantic structure.
- **Tailwind CSS integration** for fast, utility-first styling.
- **Prebuilt responsive layouts** optimized for both desktop and mobile.
- **Custom UI components** for dashboards, analytics, and timers.

### ⚙️ Backend & Functionality
- **Firebase Firestore Integration** for real-time data storage.
- **Live Synchronization:** App updates instantly when Firestore data changes.
- **Dynamic Usage Breakdown:** Displays app-wise time distribution.
- **Focus Sessions Tracking:** Converts total minutes into “focus sessions” (25 minutes = 1 session).
- **Automatic Updates:** UI auto-refreshes without reloading the page.

### 📊 Dashboard & Analytics
- Displays:
  - 🕒 **Total Screen Time**
  - 📱 **App-Wise Usage Breakdown**
  - 🎯 **Focus Session Count**
- Supports **multi-page navigation** (`index.html`, `analytics.html`, etc.).
- Optimized for **real-time visual analytics**.

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

### 🧰 Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v12.x or higher)
- npm or yarn
- A Firebase project (for Firestore setup)

### 🧾 Steps to Run

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/DeepSync.git
   cd DeepSync
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Set up Firebase**
   Create a file at `js/firebase-config.js` and add your Firebase credentials:
   ```js
   export const firebaseConfig = {
     apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
     authDomain: "your-app.firebaseapp.com",
     projectId: "your-project-id",
     storageBucket: "your-app.appspot.com",
     messagingSenderId: "XXXXXX",
     appId: "XXXXXX"
   };
   ```

4. **Start the development environment**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   This will automatically watch for changes and rebuild CSS using Tailwind.

5. **Build for production**
   ```bash
   npm run build:css
   ```

## 🧠 How It Works

### 🔥 Firebase Real-Time Listener
DeepSync uses Firebase’s **onSnapshot()** method to monitor Firestore collections in real time.  
Whenever data in Firestore updates (like screen time or focus sessions), the UI updates automatically.

### 📈 Data Flow
1. Firebase initializes using `firebase-config.js`
2. Real-time listener subscribes to the user’s data document (`usage/{userId}`)
3. Data (like duration and app usage) is processed and visualized instantly
4. Tailwind components update the dashboard dynamically

### 🧮 Example Function
```js
function formatMinutes(mins) {
  const h = Math.floor(mins/60);
  const m = mins%60;
  return `${h}h ${m}m`;
}
```
Used to display human-readable time formats in the dashboard.

## 🎨 Styling

DeepSync uses **Tailwind CSS** for all UI styling with extra plugins for animations, typography, and responsiveness.

### 🧩 Included Plugins
- `@tailwindcss/forms` → Improved input styling  
- `@tailwindcss/typography` → Beautiful readable text layouts  
- `@tailwindcss/container-queries` → Adaptive containers  
- `tailwindcss-animate` → Smooth animations  
- `tailwindcss-elevation` → Realistic shadow effects  
- `tailwindcss-fluid-type` → Responsive fluid typography
